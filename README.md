# Nightscout Menu App (Mac)

## Overview
This app was built in the same spirit as the previous two great solutions to show your key Nightscout stats in the Mac OS menu bar:
* [mddub/nightscout-osx-menubar - GitHub](https://github.com/mddub/nightscout-osx-menubar)
* [Nightscout Menu Bar - GitHub](https://github.com/mpangburn/NightscoutMenuBar)

This solution is 100% native (no Python or external dependancies), and adds a few extra features/info.
