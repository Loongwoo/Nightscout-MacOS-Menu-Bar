## Overview

This app was built in the same spirit as the previous two great solutions to show your key Nightscout stats in the Mac OS menu bar:
* [mddub/nightscout-osx-menubar - GitHub](https://github.com/mddub/nightscout-osx-menubar)
* [Nightscout Menu Bar - GitHub](https://github.com/mpangburn/NightscoutMenuBar)

This solution is 100% native (no Python or external dependancies), and adds a few extra features/info.

I do this because I'm a type 1 diabetic myself (and use a Mac). I'm not doing it to make money, but a few people have asked to contribute so here's the deal:
* If I get up to USD 99 in donations in a year, this will go to paying for my Apple Developer License
* Anything over USD 99 I'll donate to the Nightscout foundation (https://www.nightscoutfoundation.org/)
